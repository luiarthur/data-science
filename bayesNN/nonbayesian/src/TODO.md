# TODO

- [ ] Refer to Coursera hw 3 and 4. Look at optimization steps.
- [ ] Test on MNIST
- [ ] Make the user experience as good as the Bayesian implementation
- [ ] Don't try to make the Bayesian one work...
    - I think it's pointless. If you just want uncertainty estimates, I think
      you can just tweak the last layer's (A_L) values (e.g. normalize across the
      different nodes.)
